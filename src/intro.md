# Minecraft Server Admin Guide

Welcome to this guide! This book aims to provide a full guide into setting up
and maintaining a Minecraft Java edition server!

Hopefully this can help make setting up your server a little bit easier. Feel
free to share this with your staff members as a guide on how to use plugins!

## What does this book aim to do?

With this book I aim to provide full documentation for setting up and using
as many of the popular plugins as possible.

Not only do I explain how to set everything up, but also all the commands you
need to know to use all of the features of the plugins.
