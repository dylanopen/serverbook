# ViaVersion installation

Installing ViaVersion should be as simple as downloading the plugin or mod's
.jar file and uploading it to your server's `plugins` folder.

## Bukkit/Paper servers

For Bukkit/Paper servers, you can install `ViaVersion`, which is a plugin.

For server hosts with a plugins tab, you should be able to find `ViaVersion`
there.

## ViaFabric (for Fabric servers)

If your server isn't running PaperMC or another Bukkit-based server software,
but is instead using Fabric, you can install the `ViaFabric` mod.

`ViaFabric` and `ViaFabricPlus` both support clients, allowing players to 
connect to servers on any version they want, but `ViaFabric` also supports 
servers. When on a server, `ViaFabric` works very similarly to how `ViaVersion`
works, just for Fabric servers.

Important: as far as I'm aware, `ViaFabricPlus` does not work on servers. Use
regular `ViaFabric` instead.

## Setup

After installing ViaVersion, you shouldn't need to do anything. Newer clients
will be able to connect to your server with no configuration needed.
