# ViaVersion add-ons

If you also want to allow clients **older** than the server itself, you can
install the ViaBackwards mod. Install it just like you installed ViaVersion or
ViaFabric.

There are also `ViaRewind` (for *very* old versions pre-1.8.9) and
`ViaAprilFools` (which supports clients from april fools versions). You probably
don't need to install them, but they're listed below in case.

> <https://modrinth.com/plugin/viarewind>  
> <https://modrinth.com/plugin/viaaprilfools>  

It's important to note that these versions may depend on ViaVersion or ViaFabric
being installed, so if you need any of the extensions, install the main
ViaVersion too.

> `ViaBackwards`, `ViaRewind` and `ViaAprilFools` support *both ViaVersion and*
> *ViaFabric*. If you're using ViaVersion (plugin-based server like Paper) put
> the addons in your server's `plugins` folder. If you're using Fabric, you can
> put the addons in your `mods` folder.
