# Vanish

One essential plugin for server moderation is a /vanish plugin. They allow you
to go invisible on your server to essentially spy on other players.

## Why is that useful?

Often, you'll want to check that a certain player isn't causing any trouble. You
could do this using spectator mode, but most people will stop causing chaos if
they see your little grey name in the tablist \:)
