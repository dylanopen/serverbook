# Floodgate

Floodgate is an extention for [GeyserMC](./geysermc.md), meaning you need Geyser
installed as a plugin. Please see the [previous chapter](./geysermc.md) or the
[Floodgate config](./floodate/config.md) config options needed for Geyser to support Floodgate.

Floodgate allows servers in online-mode to connect to your server, without
needing a Java account. If you use Geyser, you should probably install this too.
