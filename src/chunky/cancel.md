# Cancel command

Use the `chunky cancel` command to *stop pregenerating a world*.

> After using this command, you cannot resume pregeneration. If you just want
  to temporarily pause Chunky, you should instead use Chunky's 
  [pause command](./pause.md).

## Command usage

```
/chunky cancel
```

## When to use

You can only use `chunky cancel` if a chunky task is currently in progress. In
other words, you can only run this after starting the pregeneration with the
`/chunky start` command.
