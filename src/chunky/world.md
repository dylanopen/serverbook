# World command

The `chunky world` command allows you to set the world Chunky should pregenerate
in (for vanilla servers, this is the dimension).

## Command usage

```
/chunky world <world>
```

## List of worlds

On Paper servers, you will usually have 3 worlds by default:

- `world` - the overworld dimension
- `world_nether` - the nether dimension
- `world_the_end` - the end dimension

> You may have more worlds than this, especially if you use custom plugins which
  add worlds or dimensions.

## Example usages

Tell Chunky to pregenerate chunks in the **overworld**:

```
/chunky world world
```

Tell Chunky to pregenerate chunks in the **nether**:

```
/chunky world world_nether
```

Tell Chunky to pregenerate chunks in the **end**:

```
/chunky world world_the_end
```
