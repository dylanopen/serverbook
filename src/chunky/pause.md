# Pause command

Use the `chunky cancel` command to *temporarily stop pregenerating a world*.

> After using this command, you can resume pregeneration using the chunky
  [continue command](./continue.md).  
  If you instead would like to permanantly cancel the pregen, you should instead
  use the [cancel command](./cancel.md).

## Command usage

```
/chunky pause
```

## When to use

You can only use `chunky pause` if a chunky task is currently in progress. In
other words, you can only run this after starting the pregeneration with the
`/chunky start` command.
