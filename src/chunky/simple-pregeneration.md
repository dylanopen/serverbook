# Pregenerating a world

> You must set a (fairly) small worldborder before generating the world. By
  following the steps in this page, Chunky will begin to pregenerate the world
  inside the border.

## Pregenerating the overworld

If you want to pregenerate the overworld dimension, run these commands while
standing in the overworld:

```
/chunky world world
/chunky worldborder
/chunky start
```

## Pregenerating the nether

If you want to pregenerate the nether dimension, run these commands while
standing in the nether:

```
/chunky world world_nether
/chunky worldborder
/chunky start
```

## Pregenerating the end

If you want to pregenerate the end dimension, run these commands while you
are standing in the end:

```
/chunky world world_the_end
/chunky worldborder
/chunky start
```
