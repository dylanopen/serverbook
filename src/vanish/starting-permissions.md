# Good starting permissions

## Default

The `default` role doesn't need any vanish permissions.

## Moderator

- vanish.use
- vanish.see

Note that you may want to temporarily disable the `vanish.see` permission for
moderators, if you want to spectate a mod. Sometimes it's helpful to not give
mods permission to see other vanished players \:)

## Admin

There aren't any extra permissions admins should have that they don't already
have from the moderator parent. But if you don't want mods to see other
vanished players, you should allow admins to with the `vanish.see` permission so
at least admins can see each other when in vanish.
