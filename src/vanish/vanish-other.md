# Vanishing other players

Provanish has a `/vanish` command which can vanish not only yourself but also
another player.

Note that this won't make them invisible to any player which has the `vanish.see`
permission - players with that permission can see people even when they're in
vanish.

## Command to vanish another player

Simply run this command to make a player invisible to others:

``` text
/vanish <player>
```

## Command to unvanish

Provanish uses the same command to vanish as to unvanish! That means to unvanish
someone, just type this:

``` text
/vanish <player>
```
