# Vanishing yourself

Provanish has a `/vanish` command which will make you invisible to other
players.

Note that this won't make you invisible to any player which has the `vanish.see`
permission - players with that permission can see people even when they're in
vanish.

## Command to vanish

Simply run this command to make yourself invisible to others:

``` text
/vanish
```

## Command to unvanish

Provanish uses the same command to vanish as to unvanish! That means to unvanish
yourself, just type this:

``` text
/vanish
```
