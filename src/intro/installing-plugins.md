# Installing plugins

In this guide, I mostly document the manual way of installing plugins: uploading
the plugins `.jar` file to your server's `plugins` folder.

If you're using a hosting provider, your game panel should provide a way to
easily install plugins. Instead of directly adding the `jar` file to your
server, you are welcome to install the plugin through a `Plugins` tab if you
would rather.

## Plugin repositories

The two places I'd recommend installing plugins from are:

- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) - for most plugins
- [Paper Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io) - for paper-specific plugins

You can also find plugins at [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/),
however try to find the plugin on Modrinth or Hangar first.
