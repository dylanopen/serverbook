# Server software

There are a lot of different Minecraft server softwares. The two I'd recommend
are:

- `Purpur`, based on Paper - compatible with all `Bukkit` plugins and very
  well optimised.
- `Fabric`, for fully vanilla behaviour and loading Fabric mods, but Fabric is
  not as well optimised.

This guide mainly focuses on `Purpur`. Almost all information in this guide will
also be compatible with regular Paper and likely Bukkit/Spigot - perhaps with
the exception of certain optimisation guides.
