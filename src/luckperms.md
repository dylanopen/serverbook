# LuckPerms

LuckPerms allows you to create groups for players and give them certain
permissions.

Why is this useful compared to just using `/op`? Opped players have *every
permission*, and you might not want to give all players full access to every
command.

## What can you do with LuckPerms?

LuckPerms allows you give certain groups of people specific permissions. For
example, you could have a `Moderator` role who could switch gamemodes, teleport
to other players and ban people, but would not have full OP.
