# Query parameters

CoreProtect provides lots of parameters you can specify to help narrow down your
search or rollback.

They act as filters: if an event doesn't match one of the filters, it will be
removed from the results and won't show up in the lookup and won't be rolled
back.

## List of parameters

- [action/a](./action-parameter.md)
- [user/u](./action-parameter.md)
- [radius/r](./action-parameter.md)
- [time/t](./action-parameter.md)
- [include/i](./action-parameter.md)
- [exclude/e](./action-parameter.md)

## Flags

CoreProtect also allows you to specify extra information about what you want the
command to do. You should add these flags at the end of your command.

CoreProtect flags start with a hastag (`#`).
