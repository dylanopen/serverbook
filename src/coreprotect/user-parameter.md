# User parameter

The `user` query filter parameter allows us to filter the events by the user
that performed them.

The user could be a player, but could also be another entity in the world, for
example, TNT.

## Syntax

You can query for only events by a specfic user in one of these ways:

```
user:USER
u:USER
```

## Types of user

While `user` is often the username of a player, it can also be one of these
special user types:

- `...`
