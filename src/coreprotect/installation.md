## Building from source

CoreProtect hasn't updated in a while, but you can get an up-to-date version if
you are comfortable with compiling the plugin yourself.

for help on building CoreProtect from scratch.

## Setup

Unless you wish to use a custom database, you don't need to make any changes to
the Coreprotect config to get it up and running. The default configuration works
out-of-the-box.
