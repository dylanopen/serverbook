# CoreProtect undo

It's important to be able to undo a rollback if you mess up the command.
Coreprotect makes this easy.

## Command usage

It's very easy to undo a coreprotect action...

```
/co undo
```

... *if* you only want to undo the *last action* (the last rollback/restore).

If you want to undo a rollback from the past, you need to use the
[restore](./restore.md) command. Restore essentially undoes the actions of a
rollback.
