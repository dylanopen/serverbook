# CoreProtect alternatives

If you're using Fabric, CoreProtect isn't available. The best alternative is
`Ledger`. Ledger isn't covered in this guide, but you should be able to figure
out the commands. Installation is as simple as adding the mod's `.jar` file to
your `mods` folder. You can find the .jar at <https://modrinth.com/plugin/ledger>


If you are using a Bukkit-based server software like Paper but don't want to use
CoreProtect, you can try <https://modrinth.com/plugin/prism>. Setup is a little
more involved though, as you need to set up a custom database and link to it, so
Prism isn't covered in this guide.

If you are using **Sponge**, `Prism` is the best option.
