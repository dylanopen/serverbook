# LuckPerms player permissions

You can set permissions for either a group or an individual player.

Permissions determine which commands a player has access to. There are generally
separate permissions for each command, giving you a lot of control over what
commands they can access.

> Note: it's usually better to add permissions to groups rather than players,
  but if you only want to give a permission to a single person, you *can* just
  use player permissions.
