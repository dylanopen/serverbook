# Good starting permissions

You can manage who can use luckperms, using luckperms! Basically, that means you
can use luckperms to give certain groups access to use certain luckperms
commands.

> This page will, in the future, contain a list of good defaults for permissions
  to set in order to help manage who can use luckperms.

If you don't set any luckperms permissions for groups, only players with `op`
can use LuckPerms.
