# LuckPerms installation

You can install LuckPerms like any other plugin: download the plugin jar and
place it into your server's `plugins` folder.

## Setup

Once installed, you shouldn't need to change anything about LuckPerm's config
unless you need a custom use case, for example, connecting to a custom database.

LuckPerms is fully configured using the `/lp` command and the web editor.
