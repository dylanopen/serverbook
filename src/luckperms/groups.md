# LuckPerms groups

A luckperm 'group' is essentially like a rank. Players can be in multiple groups
at once, and they will gain permissions from all groups they are in.

Groups can also *inherit* (extend) from other groups. For example, you could
have an `Admin` group which inherits from the `Moderator` group, meaning admins
would have all the permissions moderators had, plus any extra that only admins
have.

## What can groups do?

- Give players permissions to use certain commands
- Give players prefixes and suffixes
