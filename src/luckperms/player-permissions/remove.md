# Removing a permission from a player

To remove a permission from a player, use this command:

``` text
/lp user <player> permission unset <permission>
```

Using our example above, we can remove the teleport permission from
`Minecraft123` like this:

``` text
/lp user Minecraft123 permission unset minecraft.command.teleport
```
