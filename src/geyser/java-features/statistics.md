# World statistics

In Java edition, you can view statistics about your time on a server, such as
how many of a certain type of block you have mined, or how long you have played
the server.

Geyser brings this missing functionality to bedrock with the
`/geyser statistics` command.

## Command usage

Running this command on bedrock will bring up a Java-style statistics menu:

```
/geyser statistics
```
