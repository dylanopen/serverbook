# Offhand for any item

In Java edition, you can put any item in your offhand, while in bedrock, only
some items such as shields can be placed in the offhand.

Geyser allows bedrock players to place any item in their offhand, by using the
`/geyser offhand` command.

## Command usage

This command will swap the item in your offhand with the item in your main hand,
if you are a bedrock player:

```
/geyser offhand
```
