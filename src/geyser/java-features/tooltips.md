# Tooltips for items

In Java edition, you can see extra information about an item, such as its NBT
tags, durability, etc. by pressing `F3 + H` then hovering over the item in an
inventory. Bedrock does not have this.

Geyser allows bedrock players to view these advanced tooltips by using the
`/geyser offhand` command.

## Command usage

This command will show advanced tooltips about items, if you are a bedrock
player:

```
/geyser tooltips
```
