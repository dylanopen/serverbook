# Java features

Java edition has some features that bedrock edition lacks. These include (but
are not limited to):

- [Offhand for any item](./java-features/offhand.md)
- [Tooltips for items](./java-features/tooltips.md)
- [Advancements](./java-features/advancements.md)
- [World statistics](./java-features/statistics.md)

GeyserMC provides the above features to bedrock clients using commands. Bedrock
players can run a command to get similar functionality to that on Java edition.

See the pages specific to each command for more details.
