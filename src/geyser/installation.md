# Installing the Geyser plugin

First, add the jar file to your `plugins` directory. You can find GeyserMC at
<https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyser>.

This should be enough if you already have bedrock's default port (19132)
forwarded or allocated, and you don't want to use floodgate. If you want to use
a different port number (for example, on shared hosting) please read on.
