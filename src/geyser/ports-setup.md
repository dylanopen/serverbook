# Geyser ports setup

GeyserMC must use a different port to your default Java edition port.

If you're using a shared hosting provider:
- Find the tab for managing port allocations
- Create a new port allocation
- Note down the port number

If you're self-hosting:
- Go into your router's admin panel
- Find the option for port forwarding
- Open a port up for LAN and WAN port for the `UDP` protocol
- Note down the port number you chose

> Note: the default bedrock port is `19132`. You should always choose that port
> number if possible, otherwise bedrock players will have to manually type in
> the port.
