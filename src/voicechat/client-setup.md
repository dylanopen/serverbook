# Setup on clients

2. Log in to the server
3. Press 'V' and follow the setup instructions
4. Start talking!

## Groups

If you press `G`, you can manage the different groups and join those groups.

Groups allow you to talk to other players (optionally in private), and allow you
to keep talking to each other even if you are no longer near each other.

### Types of group

- `Normal` - you can hear players outside the group (when nearby) but they can't
  hear you.
- `Open` - you can hear players outside the group (when nearby) and they can
  also hear you.
- `Isolated` - you can't hear players outside the group, and they can't hear
  you.
