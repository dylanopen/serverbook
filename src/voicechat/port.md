# Port allocation

Before adding the plugin to your server, you should first allocate a port for
it. This port should be a UDP port.

- If you're using a hosting provider, you should be able to create a new UDP
  port allocation through the `Network` or `Ports` tab.
- If you're self-hosting, you will need to port forward a new port number, in
  the same way you forwarded your main server's port.

Once your port is allocated, note down the port number and continue to [Plugin
installation](./plugin-installation.md)
