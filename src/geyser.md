# GeyserMC

GeyserMC is a plugin that allows bedrock players to join your Java server. It
works by translating bedrock packets into Java packets, allowing for cross-play
between the two versions.

It's especially useful with the `Floodgate` plugin, as that way, bedrock players
can join without a Java account.
