# Floodgate config

As mentioned in the [GeyserMC chapter](../geyser.md), you need to set a few
settings in Geyser's `config.yml`:

``` yml
address: auto
auth-type: floodgate
```

Floodgate is mostly configured through GeyserMC, so check the configure options
for [Geyser](../geyser) for more information.
