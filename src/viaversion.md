# ViaVersion

ViaVersion allows players who aren't playing on the same version your server is
on to still connect to your server.

For example, if your player is on version 1.21.8 but your server still runs
1.21.6, ViaVersion translates the packets which allows the player to join the
server, even though they're on the wrong version.
